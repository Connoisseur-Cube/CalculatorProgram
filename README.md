# CalculatorProgram
It is a Calculator program made in Java with ANT in Apache netbeans, with GUI and event handling.

I am sorting out a few kinks here and there. If you want to see a feature you want to see added, or find a bug, please write it in the Issues tab.

The purpose of this project is purely educational. It is to learn about java events and how to deploy java apps, etc.
